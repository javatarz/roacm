Yes, you heard that right! I just got notification from the asset management team at ThoughtWorks that [IDEA IntelliJ 14 is out](http://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/11/intellij-idea-14-is-released/) and we get free upgrades (since we have an upgrade subscription). If you haven't seen the features already, you should check it out! It looks like an upgrade worth making, especially since it's free ;)

So go ahead and upgrade now!
