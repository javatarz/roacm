If you don't mind using Spotify in a browser, you can use [Hola Better Internet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hola-better-internet/gkojfkhlekighikafcpjkiklfbnlmeio?hl=en).

Admittedly, it's not as cool as using the Spotify client on desktop but it's certainly a lot simpler (and quicker) than managing proxy settings yourself ;)
