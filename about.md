Hey there!

I'm [Karun Japhet]({{site.bio_url}}), a Solution Consultant at [Sahaj Software](https://sahaj.ai) with over 15 years of experience building enterprise-grade solutions across ad-tech, finance, telecommunications, energy, and gaming.

This blog is my **devlog** — a space where I document the weird, wonderful, and occasionally useful experiments I do with code. Whether it's a deep dive into a technical problem, a script that saved me hours, or a thought on how we build software, you'll find it here.

## What I'm into these days

I'm focused on **AI-assisted software development** — not just code generation, but how AI can help throughout the development lifecycle. From sharpening requirements to debugging production issues, I explore techniques such as prompt engineering, context engineering, and chain-of-thought prompting to get the most out of tools like Claude Code and Copilot.

## Beyond the keyboard

I speak at conferences and meetups about topics that fascinate me — event-driven architectures, serverless microservices, ML for fraud detection, and more recently, practical AI in the software lifecycle. Here's a recent talk:
