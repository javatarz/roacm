Hi there stranger!

I'm [Karun Japhet]({{site.bio_url}}) and this is my de**vlog** for all the weird things I do on the computer that random internet folks in the distant future might be interested in :) This includes either tech topics I'd like to talk about or scripts/utilities I found useful that I'd like to share and/or find with a lot more ease in the future.

Feel free to catch up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_user}}) or [Facebook](https://facebook.com/{{site.facebook_user}}) ;) Did you check out [my portfolio page yet]({{site.bio_url}})?

I'm also a O'Reilly Software Architecture speaker. You can watch a video on youtube.
