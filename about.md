Hey there!

I'm [Karun Japhet]({{site.bio_url}}) — an engineer and consultant at Sahaj Software. I work on large-scale systems, architecture, and the practical use of AI in everyday software development. Most of my time goes into helping teams design systems that are easy to understand and evolve — especially as AI becomes part of the engineering workflow.

This blog is my devlog: experiments, breakdowns, small tools, and notes from the edges of my work. Some posts are deep dives, others are quick wins, and a few are explorations—ideas I understood better by writing them down.

## What I’m exploring these days

My current focus is **AI-assisted engineering** — not just code generation, but the full lifecycle:

- working with AI to clarify requirements
- using LLMs as architectural thinking partners
- debugging with structured prompting
- improving delivery workflows with intelligent tools

I use techniques like prompt engineering, context engineering, system prompting, and chain-of-thought scaffolding, mostly with tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

If you're interested in practical, real-world AI for software teams, this is what I write about.

## Beyond the keyboard

I speak at conferences and meetups about distributed systems, event-driven design, large-scale data engineering, ML for fraud detection, and — increasingly — AI's role in the software lifecycle.

Here’s one of my recent talks:
