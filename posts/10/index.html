<p>Right click the address bar and click Edit search engine. Click add, fill in a name and a keyword followed by the search query.
For adding the Messenger Plus Forum Search engine I used the name as “Messenger Plus! Forum Search” (doesn’t really matter what you use here), the keyword as “mpf” and the url as “http://msghelp.net/basicsearch.php?do=search&amp;keywords=<strong><em>%s</em></strong>” where <em>%s</em> represents the search query entered. As a result of adding this, I can now search the MP!F simply by typing “mpf “. I love search shortcuts :)</p>

    <p>Having heard all the rage about Google Chrome, I decided to try it out this Friday morning before leaving for college. What’s this I see? An online install? Of course it doesn’t mean much to people who have connections which can download the 7.3MB installer in a few seconds but for others, its a bit more arduous. Here’s a direct download link to the Google Chrome installer for others like me who have connections which are as slow as if not slower than broadband ;) <a href="http://74.125.15.83/chrome/install/149.29/chrome_installer.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To download the full Google Chrome Installer (7.3 MB) click here</a>.</p> <p>Chrome is Google’s

    <p>Every gadget I’ve owned to this day has been personalised. Its just something I have to do (if the hacks make the device better). I’ve done it so far with my i-Mate KJAM (custom ROMs for WM5 and WM6 and even cooking some up once in a while), my brother’s PSP and my computer (that counts too, doesn’t it? :P) among others.But when my brother came home last month, he exchanged the 2nd hand 30 GB iPod (5.5 Generation; Black) that he had.</p> <p>I had always heard of the legend that is the iPod but never actually used it, believe

    <p>So welcome to the new home of j@x, the minimalistic CMS made by.. well me :-)</p> <p>Lets clear up a few things. I was supposed to release the new version of j@x with the arrival of this domain, this didn’t happen.</p> <p>The new version will have quite a few improvements along with an alternate theme and may be even AJAX. Who knows? :P One thing it won’t have a set of emotes. In true j@x fashion, this site has to remain geeky and ASCII emotes are certainly the way ;)</p> <p>Moving on, why this domain name?

    <p>On 10th of December, 2008, 2 days before my Computer Networks paper I made a WhatPulse class in php to get data from the WhatPulse WebAPI for you to work with. With the information at your finger tips make a forum signature, why don’t you? ;) I’ve added a few functions to the class and written a small example for people to use. Most people must have it already because the WebAPI came out around 2 years ago but in case there is someone who doesn’t have <strong>caching of the WhatPulse data</strong> then this is useful.</p> <p>Caching of data means

    <p>I should officially be named the PPC hack king when it comes down to recovering them from positions where it seems they might be bricked :P</p> <p>I installed a custom cooked WM6 ROM for my Wizard (I-Mate K-JAM) and then moved to a second custom ROM, which quite sadly, crashed. This time it got stuck in the IPL/SPL load screen so here is what you do when you’re in such a dilemma.</p> <p>Remove your battery and then insert it again so now your device is off. Then press the power button + camera button and the phone will start off

    <p>The term “Wizard” refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Wizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTC Wizard</a> which is a Windows Mobile sold by companies like I-Mate and O2.</p> <p>Now the manual simply states that one should press the communications and voice buttons simultaneously and then press the reset key with your stylus. Well I can say honestly, <strong>that didn’t work for me.</strong></p> <p>Here is how you can <strong>really</strong> hard reset your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Wizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTC Wizard</a>.

    <p>So finally I got bugged with UAC enough to switch it off a few weeks back. Not all of it though. Just the module for approval from an admin and the elevation without prompting. Here is how you can do it.</p> <p>Click Start &gt; Type “local” and enter (to open Local Security Policy) &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; Browse down to the set of UAC controls.</p> <p>Now I disabled the “User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account” and set the “User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode”
