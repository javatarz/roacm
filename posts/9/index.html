    <p>Microsoft is usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eager to release updates</a> to its products. I have been seeing Vista SP2 news and downloadable links all over the internets. Release Candidates have been around for a while now but I never got any of them because I didn’t want to spend an hour or so on the update (that’s how long SP1 took to install) and then possibly have to do it again when the final SP2 comes out. I was just waiting for Microsoft to push SP2 through Windows Update.</p> <p>Microsoft <strong>has</strong> come up with the RTM for Vista SP2. They have asked

    <p>Yes, they are out! You might have been hearing about the two for the past week or two around the interneticle blogosphere. I certainly did and as with every VS release, I was excited. VS is the best IDE I have seen so its no surprise that a new release excites me.</p> <p>Initial reports state that the editor now uses WPF at points, has a brand new editor and improvements in syntaxes. Another thing they have changed is VS 2010 now has native support for F# :o This release isn’t really high on performance and optimization but gives you a

    <p>I guess a lot of programming lovers are into development on smaller platforms. I certainly am one of them. I usually speak of work I’ve done on actual programs when in actuality, there are a lot more smaller pieces of code that I write that never get shown off publically. Most of them are known to a select group of people; the ones who are meant to find use to it.</p> <p>Not many know this but despite mIRC scripting being non mainstream and not a perfectly good platform to do a lot on, I spend a lot of time (perhaps

    <p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolfram Alpha</a> (also called WoflramAlpha or Wolfram|Alpha)? If you haven’t, you best do it quickly. Its going to be brought online in about 30 minutes from now. I can’t wait! :D</p>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha is an answer-engine developed by Wolfram Research headed by British CEO and founder, physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Wolfram</a>. It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer instead of providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer.

    <p>I’ve had a bit of reprieve from work here and I finally got some time to install Windows 7 on my laptop. Though my desktop has had the latest builds available to me, they have all been on a test drive. My laptop however had to wait until I was done with my academic work before it could move permanently to Windows 7 and afford any issues that might come its way.</p>

<p>So here are a few things I’ve found interesting in Windows 7 that should make your Windows 7 User eXperience a lot more enjoyable.

    <p>I admit, its not a public build but I really couldn’t help myself so I got hold of a copy off a public torrent and here I am. I’ve had Windows 7 discs and keys around for a couple of months now but I never really got time to install them. Finally, I queued up the latest build a couple of nights ago and FINALLY it completed downloading.</p> <p>Needless to say the new taskbar is pretty cool. I do have a few suggestions though.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Aero Snap for minimization:</strong> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aero Snap</a> provides us with a set area on the

    <p>Once upon a time, not too far long ago, I got a Dell Studio XPS 1640. I found that the laptop was great. I knew before I got it that it had a slight heating problem so ever since I got it, I would give it some cooling space. The performance on this machine was simply amazing but I had a few issues. Here are the issues I had:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Didn’t receive any Intel Centrino 2 and Microsoft Windows Vista labels.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bottom (access) panel wasn’t correctly fit in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Left hinge on my laptop was incorrectly

    <p>My new laptop is a work box and doesn’t inherit the obsessive compulsiveness of File naming and sorting that my desktop hard disks have. I have, for this reason, dumped all wallpapers which are applicable to be used with my desktop (wallpapers with aspect ratio 16:9) into my “My Pictures” folder. Randomly, I have an urge to change the wallpaper and I really don’t want to go select one. So I thought I should have something that would change my wallpaper to a random image. I tried finding something but most such applications were installables and would change the wallpapers

    <p>Earlier today at CES 2009, Microsoft announced that they would release 2.5 million copies of Windows 7 for public beta (build 7000) which came out around 25th December, 2008 for all those lucky people who have MSDN subscriptions. The plan was to release the ISO around 12 CET and a page to release 2.5 million keys but here’s what happened.</p> <p>12 CET - Nothing’s up on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechNet</a> :( 12.30 CET - A statement stating the site is ill equipped for the load and things are being “set up”.. <em>sure</em> I’d buy that :P 13.30 CET - Start download from
