    <p>I finally took the time out to move away from shared hosting into my own server. It’s been a long time coming but it’s finally here! I hope this will stop issues for Wordpress caused by shared hosting. If it doesn’t, it’s out with Wordpress :)</p> <p>I ported over data and my database after cleaning up the infections. I have, however lost some of the uploaded images from my past posts so any issues there are regretted :( These images are gone from my Dreamhost server and hence can’t be ported over.. oh well :’(</p> <p>Thanks once again to those

    <p>This is a really old trick for Universal Flash Drives (UFDs) and I’ve been using it for years. I just thought I should document the steps so it’s available as quick reference for me :)</p> <ol> <li> <p>Insert your UFD and make sure all your data is backed up because we’re going to format it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run command prompt</p> </li> <li> <p>Open diskpart (will ask for elevation)</p> </li> <li> <p>Type “list disk”</p> </li> <li> <p>find what disk is your USB based on the size. Mine is number 3.</p> </li> <li> <p>type “select disk 3” (where 3 is the number

    <p>I had this infamous issue where I was stuck with my phone unable to boot for 2 days. I documented everything I learnt so others might find it helpful and as usual, it’s on XDA for all nicey goodness :)</p>

<p>You would want to read this post either because you have already seen this issue and want a fix or haven’t seen the issue yet and want to avoid it. This tutorial has information on how to fix the bootloader Security Warning issue and how to avoid it.</p>

    <p>I was helping a friend fix his hacked site when I had to disable ESET to check where his injected code was (because the website ran an img iframe hack to download a trojan on the user’s machines). I found the issue and told him what to do but had my own machine infected in the mean while :(</p> <p>Chrome kept redirecting me to his website when I opened a new tab (which thankfully Chrome kept warning me was a malicious page). If I kept a tab open with his site, it wouldn’t redirect me again. The problem was localized

    <p>AlphaRevX totally revolutionized the S-Off scene for HTCs everywhere a few months back. I wrote a bunch of posts on XDA-Dev which showed people how to use it. But AlphaRevX doesn’t work on all software versions. One such version was 2.30.x which I was stuck on. I can now confirm that Revolutionary (formed by team unr<strong>evo</strong>ked and team AlphaRev) does work on this version too. Really simple to use.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Go to <a href="http://revolutionary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolutionary.io</a> and download revolutionary for your OS (Windows/Linux)</p> </li> <li> <p>Enter the details they request for to get your beta key. It’s pretty straight forward. You

    <p>For a first time Android user looking to customize his phone, XDA-Dev can be filled with a lot of jargon. Hope this helps users understand at least a part of it.</p> <h2 id="bootloader-aka-hboot">Bootloader a.k.a HBoot</h2> <p>This is the piece of software that runs before anything else on the phone. It basically packages it all up, tells what to run in what order etc. Every computer device has a bootloader in some form or another, be it an Android Phone, iPhone, Windows PC, iMac etc. The HBoot is accessible by switching your phone off, then holding down volume down as you

<div class="entry-content">
  
  

  
    <p>This is something one might need to do regularly. I need to because <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wget</a> often creates multiple index.html@* files despite being set up not to (my GUI for wget might forget configs.. who knows?)</p>

<p>I’m left with a couple of hundred folders with 6 html files each which to me is quite irritating. So here’s a simple command to delete files in Windows recursively.</p>

<p>del /S <strong>index.html@</strong>*</p>

<p><em>**</em>Change the “index.html@*” part to anything else you might want. Obviously, wild cards are valid. Have fun and be careful! :)</p>
