    <p>I work with engineering leaders and teams on how software is built. This spans organization design and how teams are formed, delivery systems that actually work, and platform foundations that enable scale. Over recent years, this has included building large-scale data platforms, event-driven systems, and developer experience practices—and more recently, thinking through how AI fits into the engineering lifecycle.</p>
    <p>I care deeply about designing systems that improve quality and judgment at scale, not just throughput. That means disciplined engineering: strong feedback loops, clear ownership, and quality guardrails that let organizations and teams scale without becoming fragile.</p>
